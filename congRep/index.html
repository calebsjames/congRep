            <div>Rose is a member of the so-called Kraken Caucus1, Republican legislators who following the 2020 election called for all the votes to be discounted in states where the Republican candidate for President of the United States narrowly lost. Rose joined2 a case before the Supreme Court calling for all the votes in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to be discounted alleging that some voters there followed procedures set by the wrong state officials. The case, which did not allege that any voters or election workers acted improperly, was fueled by lies and conspiracy theories.3 The Supreme Court rejected the case. Following the rejection of several cases before the Supreme Court, one legislator in the Kraken Caucus called for violence.</div>
